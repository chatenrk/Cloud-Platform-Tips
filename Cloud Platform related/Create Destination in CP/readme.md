## Check the data source
Before creating the destination, which is effectively a pointer to a data source, it's worth checking that data source manually and directly. First, so you can see for yourself what you're aiming to get to from within the SAP Cloud Platform, and second, so you know what you're looking for when you access that data source indirectly (through the destination).
